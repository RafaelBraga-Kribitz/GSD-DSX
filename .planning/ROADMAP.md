# Roadmap: gsd-dsx

**Shipped:** v2.2 Analytic Surface — Phases 13–16 (2026-08-29); v2.0.0 DSX Validity Frame — Phases 6–12 (2026-08-28); v1.1.0–v1.5.0 — Phases 1–5

> **Milestone name vs. release tag.** The DSX Validity Frame is named **v2.0.0**
> throughout planning (its archives are `v2.0.0-ROADMAP.md`, `v2.0.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`,
> `v2.0.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`), but it ships under the git tag **`v2.1.0`**. The
> `v2.0.0` tag was already published on origin (2026-08-10) against an earlier,
> partial merge of this same branch, and moving a published ref would silently break
> anyone who had already fetched it — so the completed milestone got the next free
> tag instead. The follow-on **Analytic Surface** milestone was correspondingly
> renamed from v2.1 to **v2.2** so it does not collide with that release tag. Its
> milestone name and release tag match: **v2.2.0**.

**v2.0.0 totals:** 11 phases, 89 plans, 208 tasks. Milestone audit `passed` (`.planning/milestones/v2.0.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`); all 11 phases verified and Nyquist-validated; cross-phase integration INTEGRATED.

**v2.2 totals:** 4 phases, 20 plans. Milestone audit `passed` (`.planning/milestones/v2.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`); all 4 phases verified and Nyquist-validated; cross-phase integration INTEGRATED (10/10 seams).

## Next

Both v2.0.0 and v2.2 are shipped and archived — full internal dependency graphs
and requirement coverage tables are preserved at `.planning/milestones/v2.0.0-ROADMAP.md`
and `.planning/milestones/v2.2-ROADMAP.md`. No milestone is currently queued.

Two dormant seeds carry forward from v2.0.0's close (deepen `dsx-explore-data`
into a reusable EDA protocol; grow DATA-PROFILE into hermetic EDA artifacts) —
see `.planning/STATE.md` Deferred Items. Start the next milestone with
`/gsd-new-milestone`, or promote one of the seeds into a scoped milestone.
